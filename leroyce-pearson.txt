Stretch Questions

1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    - An inline element will be placed right next to the previous element, but a
      block element will be on it's own line.
    - At least, that's what I thought it was. This post describes inline
      elements as only taking up the minimum amount of space, where block
      elements take up the whole row.
2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
    - It is placed at that postion on the page, regardless of where other
      elements are.
3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    - Use the `max-width` property.
4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    - block elements: `<div>`, `<p>`
    - inline elements: `<span>`, `<strong>`
    - inline-block element: `<textarea>`
